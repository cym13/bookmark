Description
===========

Simple command line browser independant bookmark utility.

The file generated is easy to modify by hand as it is written in YAML.

In order to help using it to tag files and directories as well as urls, it
recognises if the URL given is that of an existing file. If so, the absolute
path is substituted to help scripting by piping the output and to escape
ambiguity. This behaviour can be stopped by using the "--no-path-subs" option.

One way to see this program is to consider it a simple hashmap utility for
bash that associates a set of strings (the tags) to another one (the url).
Feel free to find other ways to use this program!
