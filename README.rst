Description
===========

Simple command line bookmark and/or tagging utility.

In order to help using it to tag files and directories as well as urls, it
recognises if the URL given is that of an existing file. If so, the absolute
path is substituted to help scripting by piping the output and to escape
ambiguity. This behaviour can be stopped by using the "--no-path-subs" option.

One way to see this program is to consider it a simple hashmap utility for
bash that associates a set of strings (the tags) to another one (the url).
Feel free to find other ways to use this program!

Msgpack is used as is it highly portable, language agnostic and yet highly
efficient.

This script is written using python3.


THIS VERSION IS STABLE.

Example
=======

::

    $ bm "http://duckduckgo.com" bad search engine

    $ bm "http://google.com" bad search engine

    $ bm -l search engine
    http://duckduckgo.com
    http://google.com

    $ bm -r "http://duckduckgo.com" bad

    $ bm "http://duckduckgo.com" cool

    $ bm "http://duckduckgo.com"
    cool
    engine
    search

    $ bm -L search engine
    http://duckduckgo.com
    http://google.com

    $ bm -L bad search engine
    http://google.com

    $ bm -l
    cool
    engine
    search
    bad

    $ cat urls | bm - atag


Installation
============

The simplest method is to use:

::

    pip install bm

Otherwise, you can do when in this directory

::

    python3 setup install

This should install the dependancies as well.

An AUR package is available for archlinux as well:

::

    yaourt -S bm


And you, how do you use it?
===========================

As many cli tools, bm is thought the Unix way: with composability in mind.
This is why it's output is mainly plain text, one entry per line with simple
separators.

I use urxvt and the urxvt-perls that allow fast link openning from the
terminal.

My main browser is qutebrowser but I had bm linked with dwb or firefox
before. To do that I keep in my configuration two keybindings that execute
external commands:

::

    set-cmd-text -s :spawn -- bm '{url}'
        b
    set-cmd-text -s :spawn -- bm -w -v -l
        B

That way, when on a page, I press b to bookmark the current url and just type
the tags on the browser prompt. B is for searching, note how it uses the html
display with -w to open the results in a new tab.

For synchronisation I relay on a script that scp's the bookmark file between
my computers and then does a local file import.

As I work on some very big projects, I also use bm to bookmark paths and
files so that I can quickly find an given set of files. To do that I have an
alias in order not to mix this work and other urls.

::

    alias fbm="bm -f ~/.path_bm"

As bm automatically expands relative paths it is well suited to this usage.

These are only some personal examples, I hope you'll find yours!
