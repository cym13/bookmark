Description
===========

Simple command line browser independant bookmark utility.

The file generated is easy to modify by hand as it is written in YAML.

In order to help using it to tag files and directories as well as urls, it
recognises if the URL given is that of an existing file. If so, the absolute
path is substituted to help scripting by piping the output and to escape
ambiguity. This behaviour can be stopped by using the "--no-path-subs" option.
